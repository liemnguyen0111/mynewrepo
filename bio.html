  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>My name is Liem, you can call me Tim.
  I worked at POWER Engineers as a drafter for about a year and few months.
  <br/>Knowing C++ and Java, so picking up a new language like Javascript isn't that bad.
  <br/>I like coding, and wanted to look an opportunity to get my feet into the tech industry as a programmer.
  <br/>I like trying new food.
  <br />And to be honest, I spend most of my time sleeping and I can sleep like almost anywhere, even while standing.<br>
<br style = "list-style: height 10px;"> 
And if you are curious about how I look like, below is a portrait of myself. :)</p>
