Hi, my name is Liem, you can call me Tim. 
I worked at POWER Engineers as a drafter for about a year and few months.
Knowing C++ and Java, so picking up a new language like Javascript isn't that bad.
I like coding, and wanted to look an opportunity to get my feet into the tech industry as a programmer.
I like trying new food.
And to be honest, I spend most of my time sleeping and I can sleep like almost anywhere, even while standing.
